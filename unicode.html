      <h4>Unicode</h4>
      <p>
        Unicode is a standard way of representing characters on a computer, derived from ASCII. Common ways of encoding character are UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. It is a method to convert a sequence of elements to characters. Because ASCII was only focused on Latin
        characters, Unicode was created to also encode other, non-Latin languages, such as Greek, Chinese, and Russian, on computers. It was also created to standardize the numerous character encodings available then. This avoided encoding conflicts,
        and thus removed the risk of data corruption.

        Although related to computers, Unicode does not relate to RAM.
