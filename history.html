      <h3>The History of RAM</h3>
      <p>Random access memory (originally known as Dynamic random access memory, or DRAM) was originally patented in 1968 as a replacement to magnetic core memory.</p>
      <p>The initial form of computer RAM was magnetic core memory, used in the 1940s. Relying on an array of magnetized rings, each individual ring could only store one bit of data. As a result, this resulted in large, inefficient installations.</p>
      <p>In later years, technological advances resulted in smaller devices that could equally store more information. The invention dynamic random access memory by Robert H. Dennard, a former employee of IBM, greatly increased the memory density at a smaller
        size. To this day, we continue to use and further develop this same form of RAM technology.</p>
