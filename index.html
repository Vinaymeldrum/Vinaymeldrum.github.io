		<h3>Welcome to this webpage!</h3>
		<p>This webpage will teach you all about RAM, also known as Random access
			memory.</p>
		<p>Random access memory, more commonly abbreviated as RAM, is a computer
			component that allows the processor to quickly access data by temporarily
			 storing the operating system, programs and data that are in current use.
			 In contrast with other data storage
			media, such as hard drives, CD, floppy disks, and USB drives, RAM can be
			read from and written to quickly. However, its data is lost each time the
			computer is powered off.</p>

		<p>An evolution from old technology, RAM was developed as a more efficient,
			 durable, and cheaper replacement to magnetic core memory.</p>
