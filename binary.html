        Computers communicate everything in 1s and 0s. The way this works is that you have to have a multiplier. Since there are 2 symbols, being 1 and 0, it means that for each column, you multiply by 2. An example is down below:<br><br>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>1</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          If you wanted to represent the number 3 in binary, you would write it as 11. Because the first two spots are 2 and 1, by putting 1, it means that you want to add that place. If you wanted to represent the number 2, you would put: 10. In the 2nd column,
          the number 2 is represented. You do not need anything inside the 2nd column (1), so you put a 0. Binary is related to RAM because RAM is composed by a bunch of tiny bits. The RAM capacitor charges and discharges, storing either a 1 or 0 in the
          cell. However, the charge in this capacitor will slowly leak away, and must be refreshed periodically. Each byte communicates with the computer, holding temporary storage. This temporary storage is stored in binary, because it is the fastest
          as it is base 2. In RAM, the higher amount of bits, the more things you can temporary store. The data that you store can be retrieved in any order, hence the name Random Access memory. As soon as you turn off your computer you lose all your
          RAM storage. A more permanent way to store things in a computer is by using an SSD. An SSD is an average of around 1000 times slower than RAM storage.
