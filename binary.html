      <p>
        Computers communicate everything in 1s and 0s. The way this works is that you have to have a multiplier. Since there are 2 symbols, being 1 and 0, it means that for each column, you multiply by 2. An example is down below:
      </p>
      <p>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
              <td>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>8</td>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>1</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wanted to represent the number 3 in binary, you would write it as 11. Because the last two columns are 2 and 1, by putting 1, it means that you want to add that place. If you wanted to represent the number 5, you would put 101. In the second column,
        the number 4 is represented. You do not need anything inside the third column (2), so you put a 0. Finally, by putting 1 on the fourth column (1), the number 1 is also represented. Because 4 and 1 are represented, added together, the result is 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Binary is related to RAM because RAM is composed by a bunch of tiny bits. The RAM capacitor charges and discharges, storing either a 1 or 0 in the
        cell. However, the charge in this capacitor will slowly leak away, and must be refreshed periodically. Each byte communicates with the computer, holding temporary storage. This temporary storage is stored in binary, because it is the fastest, being
        in base 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        In RAM, the higher amount of bits, the more things you can temporary store. Common computer systems today are in 64-bit. The stored data in RAM can be retrieved in any order, hence its name, random access memory. However, as soon as the computer is powered off, all the data in the RAM is lost. RAM is therefore not a permanent storage solution for users to save and access their data, but is for computers to quickly store temporary data for its own use.
      </p>
      <p>
        A more permanent way to store data in a computer is by using a hard drive, such as an SSD. An SSD is an average of around 1000 times slower than RAM storage, making it more ideal for long-term storage solutions, such as storing documents.
